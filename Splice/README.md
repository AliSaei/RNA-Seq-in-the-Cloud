# Detection of Novel Exons

It is clear from the proteomic diversity and functional complexity of higher order organisms 
the outdated model that one mRNA codes for one protein is implausible [REF]. 
Alternative splicing allows for a single mRNA to code for a variety of protein. 
Currently, there are a handful of computational tools [REF] available to detect novel splice junctions, 
but a common limitation among some of these tools includes the uncertainty of 
parsing biologically relevant splice junctions against experimental error. 
Additionally, there are very few methods that address investigating alternative splicing on long reads.

Here we propose a method discover novel splice junctions, both on short and long reads, 
and validate them against known exons in GENCODE and our own annotated data.

## Getting Started

Before use, it is recommended to preprocess your data (fastq? gtf?) through our metadata scripts (? and if so add link here) to ensure it is fit for analysis

### Prerequisites

input: GTF<br/>
dependencies: python 3.6.1, pandas, numpy, csv

# Detection of Novel Transcripts with TSS Support

One plausible approach to identify true novel transcripts is by searching for transcripts with alternative transcription start sites (TSSs). Intuitively, This pipline starts with extracting transcripts with at least 1 intron, and then extracts only the ones with the first exon (strand-specific) that is novel from these transcripts. The start positions (strand-specific*) of these novel first exons with standard unique identifiers are then plugged into the TSS database generated by FANTOM5; from here, the transcripts with the start position of novel first exon that is within a CAGE peak cluster or a extended CAGE peak cluster with user-defined distance are called and thus regarded as novel transcripts.

strand-specific*:if strand is -, then it is actually the last exon. Same notation applies to this entire section

## Getting Started 

Input: .gtf file
Dependencies: python 3.6.4, csv, collections

### Command Line Samples

To extract nove transcripts that satisfy: 1) have at least 1 intron, 2) (strand-specifc) first exon is not referenced:
```
python intronless_exon.py gtf_file.gtf
```
Output: exon_novel_gtf_file.gtf.tsv       (strand-specific*)
        (chr, strand, start of first exon, stop of first exon, strand, transcriptID)
